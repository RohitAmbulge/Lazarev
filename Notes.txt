Box-sizing : 
The CSS box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.

width + padding + border = actual width of an element
height + padding + border = actual height of an element

vh : viewport height--->total screen ki height
vw : The vw unit in CSS stands for "viewport width." It is a relative unit of measurement that is based on the width of the viewport. One vw is equal to 1% of the width of the viewport. This unit is particularly useful for responsive design, as it allows elements to scale relative to the size of the browser window or device screen.

opacity:The opacity property specifies the opacity/transparency of an element.
        The opacity property can take a value from 0.0 - 1.0. The lower the value, the more transparent:
